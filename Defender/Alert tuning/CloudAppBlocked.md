# Alert tuning for customer 

### Problem 
Customer has Microsoft defender for 365 and has rules which block cloud apps under a certain raiting. 
This means that there are a lot of alerts coming through which are not intresteing to look at as a single incident. 
Therefore I created an alert tuning to automatically resolve these incidents so the security team can focus on other tasks.
