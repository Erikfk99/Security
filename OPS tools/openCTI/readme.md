## Setting up OPENCTI with connectors

This is a quick guide on how to setup OPNECTI on an UBUNUTU SERVER. This will be done in two steps: 

1. portainer 
2. OPENCTI 
   1. connectors

We will be implementing OPENCTI with portainer to give ourselves a better way of managing stacks and also implementing new connectors for openCTI.
