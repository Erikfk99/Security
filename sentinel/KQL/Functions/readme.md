# Functions in log analytics workspace sentinel 
Using functions within your Microsoft Sentinel can speed up your querieing. Creating functions for things that you are usaully looking for, so you dont need to write similar expressions for everytime you create a query.

These functions are functions which I have used within Sentinel or log analytics workspaces.
